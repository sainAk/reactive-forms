# Reactive Forms

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `vite`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `vite build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html) for more information.

### `vite preview`

The vite preview command will boot up local static web server that serves the files from `dist` at [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173). It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.
